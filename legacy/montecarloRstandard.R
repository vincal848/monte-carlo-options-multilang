# SUPERSEDED. Kept for reference only -- this file is not part of the package
# and is known to be incorrect.
#
# Known defects, each with a named regression test:
#
# 1. Paths are simulated with real-world drift mu = 0.05 but discounted at the
#    risk-free rate r = 0.03. That is not risk-neutral pricing. At these
#    parameters it overprices the K=105 call by about 15% (8.18 vs a
#    Black-Scholes price of 7.13, tens of standard errors away). Pinned by
#    test_mc_price_matches_black_scholes_within_3_se in tests/test_mc.py,
#    which the replacement passes and this script would not.
# 2. simulated_paths[1, ] is set to S0 and the loop only fills rows 2:n_steps,
#    so only n_steps - 1 = 251 steps are actually simulated, while the
#    discount factor uses exp(-r * n_steps * dt) = exp(-r * T) for the full
#    year. The number of steps simulated and the horizon discounted over
#    disagree.
# 3. Builds a 10000 x 252 = 2,520,000-row payoff_data frame that nothing in
#    the script reads.
# 4. Strike prices (95, 105) do not match the C++ version's (105) or the
#    Python version, which does not price at all -- the three "same model"
#    scripts price different things.
#
# Replaced by mc.R (functions) and run.py / mc.py, the Python driver that also
# runs this file's replacement and the C++ replacement for comparison.
